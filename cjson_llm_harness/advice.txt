Here is some useful advice for generating seeds


To generate seed files for AFL++, you should create a directory named `seeds` and populate it with JSON strings of varying complexity. Here are some example seeds you can use:

1. `seeds/simple.json`
   ```json
   {}
   ```

2. `seeds/basic.json`
   ```json
   {"name": "John"}
   ```

3. `seeds/nested.json`
   ```json
   {"person": {"name": "John", "age": 30}}
   ```

4. `seeds/array.json`
   ```json
   {"names": ["John", "Jane", "Doe"]}
   ```

5. `seeds/complex.json`
   ```json
   {
       "name": "John",
       "age": 30,
       "address": {
           "street": "123 Main St",
           "city": "Anytown"
       },
       "phoneNumbers": [
           {"type": "home", "number": "123-456-7890"},
           {"type": "work", "number": "987-654-3210"}
       ]
   }
   ```
